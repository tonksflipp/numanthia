            René Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, often called the father of modern philosophy. He is best known for his statement “Cogito, ergo sum” — “I think, therefore I am.”
            Descartes sought certainty in knowledge by doubting everything that could be doubted. Through this radical skepticism, he concluded that the act of thinking was undeniable proof of one’s existence. His method emphasized reason as the foundation of knowledge, separating mind from body — a dualism that shaped centuries of philosophical debate.
            In mathematics, Descartes developed analytic geometry, bridging algebra and geometry. His scientific method focused on deduction and clear principles, influencing both Enlightenment thinkers and modern science.
            Despite his rationalist outlook, Descartes believed in God as a necessary foundation for truth and the order of the universe.
