            Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher who is often considered the father of Western philosophy. Unlike other philosophers of his time, Socrates did not leave behind written records of his teachings. Instead, most of what we know about him comes from the works of his students, primarily Plato, as well as Xenophon.
            Socrates is best known for his method of inquiry, called the "Socratic method," which involves asking a series of probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. Rather than providing answers, Socrates would challenge his interlocutors to think for themselves, encouraging self-examination and the pursuit of virtue.
            Socrates believed that knowledge and virtue were interconnected, asserting that "the unexamined life is not worth living." He emphasized the importance of understanding oneself and seeking wisdom, especially in relation to moral and ethical issues. Socrates believed that people do wrong not because they are inherently evil, but because they lack knowledge or understanding of what is truly good.
            He did not write philosophical texts, and his teachings are often conveyed through dialogues, particularly those written by Plato. Socrates was eventually tried and sentenced to death by the Athenian government for allegedly corrupting the youth and impiety. He chose to accept his sentence rather than flee, famously stating that he had a moral obligation to abide by the law.
            Socrates' ideas and methods have had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophy, shaping the way we think about ethics, knowledge, and the pursuit of truth.
