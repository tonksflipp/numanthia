            <h2>Aristotle</h2>
            <p>
            Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath, a student of Plato and tutor to Alexander the Great. He made lasting contributions to nearly every field of knowledge, including logic, metaphysics, ethics, politics, biology, and aesthetics.
            Unlike Plato, who emphasized abstract forms, Aristotle focused on observation and practical experience. He believed that knowledge begins with the senses and that understanding the world requires studying its causes and purposes—what he called "teleology."
            In ethics, Aristotle proposed that happiness (eudaimonia) is achieved through a life of virtue and rational activity. In politics, he viewed the city-state as natural and essential for human flourishing. He also developed formal logic, founding the system of syllogistic reasoning.
            Aristotle’s influence endured for over two millennia, shaping Islamic, Christian, and Western thought. His emphasis on empirical investigation laid the groundwork for modern science and philosophy.
