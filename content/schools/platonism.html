            <h2>Platonism</h2>
            <p>
                Platonism is a school of thought based on the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who lived in the 4th century BCE. At its core, Platonism holds that beyond the material world lies a realm of eternal, unchanging truthsâ€”what Plato called the "Forms" or "Ideas."
                According to Platonism, everything we perceive in the physical world is merely a shadow or imperfect copy of these perfect, abstract Forms. For example, all circular objects we see are imperfect representations of the pure, ideal Form of a circle. True knowledge, for Platonists, comes not from the senses but from reason and philosophical reflection.
                Plato also believed that the human soul is immortal and has access to these higher realities through intellectual inquiry. His vision of reality deeply influenced Western metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology.
                Platonism continued to evolve long after Plato's death, especially in the form of Neoplatonism, a later movement that blended his ideas with mystical and religious elements.
