            Epicureanism is a philosophical system founded by Epicurus in the 4th century BCE, centered on the pursuit of happiness through the cultivation of pleasure, tranquility, and freedom from fear.
            Contrary to common misconceptions, Epicureanism is not about indulgence or excess. Epicurus taught that the highest pleasure is ataraxia—a state of inner peace and the absence of mental distress. Physical pleasure matters, but it is best achieved through simplicity, moderation, and friendship.
            Epicureans believed that the gods, if they exist, are indifferent to human affairs, and that death is nothing to fear since it is simply the end of consciousness. Understanding this frees us from anxiety and allows us to live wisely and joyfully in the present.
            The school emphasized the importance of critical thinking, empirical observation, and the avoidance of unnecessary desires—encouraging a life rooted in calm, reason, and meaningful connection.
            Though once rival to Stoicism, Epicureanism still resonates today with those who value simplicity, skepticism, and serenity.
