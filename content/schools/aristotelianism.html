            Aristotelianism is the philosophical tradition based on the teachings of Aristotle, a student of Plato and tutor to Alexander the Great. Unlike Platonism, which emphasizes abstract Forms, Aristotelianism is grounded in the study of the natural world and empirical observation.
            Aristotle believed that all things have a purpose—or "telos"—and that understanding something means knowing both what it is and why it exists. He developed a system of logic, pioneered the study of biology, and deeply influenced ethics, metaphysics, politics, and aesthetics.
            In ethics, Aristotle taught that the good life is one of virtue, achieved through moderation and the cultivation of character—what he called the "Golden Mean." Rather than aiming for abstract perfection, Aristotelianism focuses on flourishing (eudaimonia) through practical wisdom and real-world engagement.
            His ideas shaped medieval philosophy, especially through thinkers like Thomas Aquinas, and continue to influence science, logic, and moral theory today.
