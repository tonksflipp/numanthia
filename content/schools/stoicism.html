            Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that teaches the development of self-control, resilience, and virtue as a path to true happiness. Founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE, it later flourished in the Roman Empire through thinkers like Seneca, Epictetus, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius.
            At the heart of Stoicism is the idea that we cannot control external events, but we can control how we respond to them. By focusing on what is within our power—our thoughts, choices, and actions—we can achieve a state of inner peace. Stoics strive to live according to reason and nature, cultivating virtues like courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom.
            Rather than suppressing emotions, Stoicism teaches us to understand and transform them. The goal is not to feel nothing, but to remain unshaken by misfortune and free from the sway of destructive impulses.
            Today, Stoicism has found a new audience among people seeking calm and clarity in a chaotic world.
