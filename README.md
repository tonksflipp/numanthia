# Numanthia

**Numanthia** is a small beginner-friendly digital encyclopedia project.  
It’s a simple website made with basic HTML and CSS, meant to organize and display short entries on different topics.

This project is mainly for learning and practice — not a professional or large-scale project.

## Features

- Basic static website with simple navigation
- Easy-to-read encyclopedia entries
- Handwritten HTML and CSS (no frameworks or CMS)
- Basic JavaScript functionality for enhanced interactivity

## Purpose

Numanthia was created as a personal learning project, to practice web development skills while exploring how to organize information in an accessible way.

## How to Use

To view the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download** or **clone** this repository to your computer.
2. Locate the `index.html` file in the project folder.
3. **Open** the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
4. **Note**: If you have any assets (images, CSS, or JS files), make sure the file paths are correct, especially if you move or rename folders.

Alternatively, you can host the project on a static site service like **GitHub Pages** to make it accessible online.
